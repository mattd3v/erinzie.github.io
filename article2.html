<h3>Being Clear with Your Doctor About Your Expectations</h3>

<p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
Today as I reflect on my pregnancy, I have the desire  to talk about birth plans and why they are so important. If you don’t know what a birth plan is, in short it’s a written plan of what your expectations are for your labor and birth.  When I spoke to my doctor about my birth plan, to be honest he wrote it off as unimportant, and being my first pregnancy I assumed “I guess it doesn’t matter”, if the doctor didn’t think it was significant. 
  <br>I just didn’t  know any better at the time. Later I found out the hard way that my trust in him for that was the wrong decision. </p>
  </p>
  <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
For me personally, having a natural vaginal birth was very important to me for many reasons. I was young, low risk, healthy, and a good family history of natural healthy births. So in my head there was no good reason for me to not have a similar experience to what I had grown up hearing about, from the women in my family. So I did not communicate with my doctor the importance to me of having a vaginal birth. He made me feel everything was just fine, nothing to really think about. </p>
  </p>
  <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
When the date came in from the doctor, that I was far enough along (39th week) to safely induce if I wanted to, we made the decision to do so. In hindsight, I was actually nervous about doing this, but my mother was in town to help and timing felt pressured so she could help me for some time after the birth.The doctor assured me that if my body was not ready then it would not work anyways and I could then return at a later date. 
<br>I was already 1 cm dilated so we thought it should be fine to help the labor along. I checked in at 6am to the hospital and very quickly they started me with the induction IV.  I began contractions though mild still, only at 2 cm dilated when the doctor came in to explain he would then break my water. </p>
  </p>
  <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
(I will add some of my (2) mothers sides of how it went since, for me, everything was new and I was not going to doubt my doctor and nurses. But for my mom, they made her feel like she had no place to be questioning and that the times had changed, so her knowledge was outdated. She also did not want to scare me. I share this because had we know how this was going down, we all would have questioned a lot more, and without guilt, until the answers made sense or were explained better.)  
  </p> 
  <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
  The doctor was of course, in a very big hurry at every stop in. 
After breaking the water the staff regularly came in to offer the epidural.  Although some family said it was way too early, the doctors  and nurses said “We don’t give out medals for pain and suffering, so anytime you want that epidural you just say so!”  
I held  off a little longer  and they kept coming in and offering the epidural. Within a couple hours or so, I was progressing but it was not that fast, and they told me, if it went too far then you will loose the chance of getting the epidural at all. (Which is true, but mind you I was still only 4 cm dilated.) I decided to go for it, why not? Like they said.
  </p>
  <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
 After that it was relaxing and I lay there watching the monitors and getting excited for the arrival of our new little one!  
The progression is very slow and even the nurses start getting worried, they  begin to help me move positions every half hour to attempt to move  things along, as with the epidural I was paralyzed waist down.  
  </p>
  <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
One of the benefits of not doing the epidural too quickly is you can move, walk, bounce and stretch to help your body kick in to progression and not only rely on the inducing drugs.  At around 8 or 9 cm dilated my uterus stops dilating and actually starts going the other  way. From 9cm to the next reading back at 8.5, and I started to swell. 
  </p>  
    <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
My son at this point is trying to birth but now it’s leading to his head swelling. The doctor quickly enters and tells us all we need to prepare for immediate C-secion or there could be serious consequences.  I start crying and my family is upset as well,  the doctor says  “this is very normal, C-sections happen now all the time, but since her water has been popped for a while now, we don’t have any time left!”
<br>Just let that sink in! 
  </p>  
   <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
Next thing I know I have been rushed off and they’re preparing me for a c-section. My husband and I wanted to have a LOT of kids, it had been his dream to have a big family for as long as he could remember, in addition it was important to me to have a vaginal birth because I really the experience of a natural birth. 
  </p> 
     <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
Of course I was confused and worried at the point of only  safety, I thought it must just be fate, but my mom had been talking to the nurses saying they know why this happened and they look pretty guilty…they admitted to her that they agree it should not be done this way but  that is how this doctor does it for many of his births
  </p> 
     <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
I hate to talk down on health care professionals because I know all the nurses did their best to make this day go smoothly for me, and everyone really was very nice to us.  However, it is easy for us now to see how our doctor was not communicative with us and that to him it did not matter one bit if it was natural. Doctors do get more money for c-sections and although there are many times when they are not only life saving but the only option, I don’t  believe this one would have been one of those, if we had known what we  know now. We were just told repeatedly, why are you crying, c-seccions are no big deal and very common now. After the birth I just couldn’t get over the idea that this all could've been different. 
  </p> 
       <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
After some research I quickly found out that if your doctor is a surgeon it’s just statistically more likely that you’ll have a c-section, this is why hospitals in even the same city can have hugely different rates of c-section and vaginal births. For a surgeon, opting out to a surgery is not usually big deal, even in a natural course of events, no malice intended,(?) it’s just the way things are. 
  </p> 
       <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
I don’t say all this to get you to trust your doctor less or create unease in your impending birth, but I say this as a fair warning to go with your gut and push for what’s important to you.
  </p> 
         <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
And of course, this goes without saying, there are times when you HAVE to have a c-session. But in my case, I believe breaking my water too early, too early of an epidural and maybe even pushing the date up, that these had a lot to do with me ending up in a c-session!
  </p> 
         <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
I feel strongly that if I had a solid birth plan, and indicated my preference for a natural birth with confidence, that things would’ve gone differently. In the end, your labor and birth is of course a very important day in your life, you shouldn’t be made to feel like your desires and preferences are over-the-top or needy. 
  </p> 
         <p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
Take the time and make a birth plan, hand it out to the people who will be taking care of you, don’t feel like a diva because you’re not, you just want this day to be right, to be special and safe for you and your baby. If you don’t know how to go about what you want for your birth or you strongly feel that you need more guidance/support, I would suggest hiring a doula. This way you can be sure you’re getting someone who will help you to have things go just how you want and educate you for things you may not otherwise be aware of.
  </p> 
<p style=“text-indent: 10%”>
Here is a place that makes it easy for you to 
<a href="https://www.dona.org/" rel="external nofollow" style="text-decoration: underline">find a doula</a>. I really hope this article helps any expecting mothers who don’t quite know what to expect, I’m so thankful my son came out safe and healthy, but if I can also help any other mothers from having a birth day less than what they hoped for, this would all be worth it.
